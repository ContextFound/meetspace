# Contributing to meetSpace

Thanks for your interest in meetSpace. Here's how to get involved.

## Bug reports and feature requests

**Bugs:** Please open an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/meetspace/meetspace/issues) with a clear description, steps to reproduce, and your environment (Python version, OS).

**Feature requests:** Open a discussion in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/meetspace/meetspace/discussions). For larger ideas, start with a discussion before submitting a PR.

## Questions and discussion

General questions, ideas, and feedback belong in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/meetspace/meetspace/discussions).

## Content format

Event `title` is plain text. Event `description` is markdown (agent-to-agent). Raw HTML is not allowed; it is stripped before storage. Clients (e.g. Flutter) render the markdown.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes. Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
3. Ensure existing tests pass (if applicable).
4. Open a PR with a clear description of the change and link any related issues.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and constructive. We're building an events API for agents and people — everyone is welcome.
